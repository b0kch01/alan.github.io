Hi, I'm **Alan Brown**.

I’m a Program Manager leading projects at the intersection of technology and healthcare. My focus is on bridging the gap between innovation and implementation.

## My Journey

I earned my B.A. from Stanford University, building a foundation in data science, technology, and human-centered design. I first applied these skills at the Stanford Psychophysiology Lab, using wearable devices to collect physiological data and gaining experience in digital health. At Google, I strengthened my project management skills, supporting validation studies of machine learning models for Fitbit devices. Now, as a Program Manager in Stanford’s Medical AI & Computer Vision Lab, I collaborate with engineers, clinicians, and data scientists to develop AI models and analytic tools that enhance healthcare decision-making.

## What I Do

I ensure AI-driven research projects are well-executed, collaborative, and aligned with technical and operational goals.

- **AI & Data Infrastructure:** Oversee data pipelines, annotation workflows, and model development for AI-driven surgical analysis.
- **Technical Operations:** Manage project execution, budgeting, vendor contracts, and compliance to support large-scale research and AI development.
- **Research to Implementation:** Coordinate efforts across engineering, data science, and healthcare to develop scalable, real-world AI solutions.

## Beyond the Work

Outside of work, I love exploring new places, whether it’s traveling abroad or discovering a great local coffee shop. I have a deep appreciation for psychology and enjoy understanding different perspectives and what drives people. You can also find me hiking, trying new noodle restaurants, or sharing funny stories that remind us not to take life too seriously. I believe a mix of curiosity, ambition, and a good sense of humor keeps things interesting, both in work and life.
