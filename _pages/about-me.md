Hi, I'm **Alan Brown**.

I lead projects at the intersection of technology and healthcare. My focus is on bridging the gap between innovation and implementation.

## My Journey

I earned my B.A. from <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>, building a foundation in data science, project management, and human-centered technology. I first applied these skills by working with wearable health technology, managing physiological data collection at the <a href="https://spl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Psychophysiology Lab</a> and supporting machine learning validation for Fitbit devices at <a href="https://enterprise.fitbit.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>. Now, as a Program Manager in the <a href="https://marvl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Medical AI & Computer Vision Lab</a>, I collaborate with engineers, clinicians, and data scientists to develop AI models and analytic tools for healthcare decision-making.

## What I Do

I ensure AI-driven research projects are well-executed, collaborative, and aligned with technical and operational goals.

- **AI & Data Infrastructure:** Oversee data pipelines, annotation workflows, and model development for AI-driven surgical analysis.
- **Technical Operations:** Manage project execution, budgeting, vendor contracts, and compliance to support large-scale research and AI development.
- **Research to Implementation:** Coordinate efforts across engineering, data science, and healthcare to develop scalable, real-world AI solutions.

## Beyond the Work

I love exploring new places, whether itâ€™s traveling abroad or discovering a great local coffee shop. You can also find me hiking, trying new noodle restaurants, or sharing funny stories that remind us not to take life too seriously. I believe a mix of curiosity, ambition, and a good sense of humor keeps things interesting, both in work and life.
