Hi, I'm **Alan Brown**.

I’m a Program Manager leading projects at the intersection of technology and healthcare. My focus is on translating research into scalable, real-world impact, bridging the gap between innovation and implementation.

## My Journey

I earned my B.A. from Stanford University, building a foundation in data science, technology, and human-centered design. I began my career at the Stanford Psychophysiology Lab, using wearable devices to collect physiological data and gaining experience in digital health. At Google, I strengthened my project management skills, supporting validation studies of machine learning models for Fitbit devices. Now, as a Program Manager in Stanford’s Medical AI & Computer Vision Lab, I collaborate with engineers, clinicians, and data scientists to develop AI models and analytic tools that enhance healthcare decision-making.

## What I Do

I currently lead a dynamic team at **Creative Spark Studios**, where we specialize in:
- **Branding & Identity:** Crafting memorable logos and brand strategies.
- **Web & App Design:** Developing intuitive, responsive digital experiences.
- **Digital Marketing:** Designing impactful social media and digital campaigns.

Our mission is to breathe life into imaginative ideas while ensuring every project is both functional and beautiful.

## A Bit of Personal Flair

When I'm not immersed in digital design, you can find me exploring hidden hiking trails, capturing moments with my vintage camera, or experimenting with gourmet recipes in the kitchen. I also enjoy blogging about my travels and sharing creative insights with fellow enthusiasts. For me, life is a canvas, and every experience adds a vibrant brushstroke to my story.
