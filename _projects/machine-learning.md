Another focus of mine is machine learning. I have contributed to work building a foundation model for diagnosing cardiac diseases on MRI ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00357)) and automatically identifying heterogeneous subgroups with variation in survival in heart transplantation ([link](<https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(24)00203-1/fulltext>)).
